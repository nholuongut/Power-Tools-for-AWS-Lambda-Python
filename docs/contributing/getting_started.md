!!! question "Still couldn't find anything that match your skill set?"
        Please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/B8zZKbbyET){target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}, specially if you'd like to get mentoring for a task you'd like to take but you don't feel ready yet :)

        Contributions are meant to be bi-directional. There's always something we can learn from each other.

## Sending a pull request

!!! note "First time creating a Pull Request? Keep [this document handy.](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/){target='blank' rel='nofollow'}"

Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

* [ ] You are working against the latest source on the **develop** branch.
* [ ] You check existing [open, and recently merged](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen%2Cmerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc){target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
* [ ] You open an [issue](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python/issues/new/choose){target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} before you begin any implementation. We value your time and bandwidth. As such, any pull requests created on non-triaged issues might not be successful.
* [ ] Create a new branch named after the change you are contributing _e.g._ `feat/logger-debug-sampling`

**Ready?**

These are the steps to send a pull request:

1. Run all formatting, linting, tests, documentation and baseline checks: `make pr`
2. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages. Don't worry about typos or format, we squash all commits during merge.
3. Send us a pull request with a [conventional semantic title](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python/pull/67).
4. Fill in the areas pre-defined in the pull request body to help expedite reviewing your work.
5. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

## Code of Conduct

## Troubleshooting

### API reference documentation

When you are working on the codebase and you use the local API reference documentation to preview your changes, you might see the following message: `Module aws_lambda_powertools not found`.

This happens when:

* You did not install the local dev environment yet
    * You can install dev deps with `make dev` command
* The code in the repository is raising an exception while the `pdoc` is scanning the codebase
    * Unfortunately, this exception is not shown to you, but if you run, `poetry run pdoc --pdf aws_lambda_powertools`, the exception is shown and you can prevent the exception from being raised
    * Once resolved the documentation should load correctly again
