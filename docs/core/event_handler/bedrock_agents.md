## Key features

* Minimal boilerplate to build Agents for Amazon Bedrock
* Automatic generation of [OpenAPI schemas](https://www.openapis.org/){target="_blank"} from your business logic code
* Built-in data validation for requests and responses
* Similar experience to authoring [REST and HTTP APIs](api_gateway.md){target="_blank"}

## Terminology

**Data validation** automatically validates the user input and the response of your AWS Lambda function against a set of constraints defined by you.

**Event handler** is a Powertools for AWS feature that processes an event, runs data parsing and validation, routes the request to a specific function, and returns a response to the caller in the proper format.

**[OpenAPI schema](https://www.openapis.org/){target="_blank"}** is an industry standard JSON-serialized string that represents the structure and parameters of your API.

**Action group** is a collection of two resources where you define the actions that the agent should carry out: an OpenAPI schema to define the APIs that the agent can invoke to carry out its tasks, and a Lambda function to execute those actions.

**Large Language Models (LLM)** are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data, capable of extracting meanings from a sequence of text and understanding the relationship between words and phrases on it.

**Agent for Amazon Bedrock** is an Amazon Bedrock feature to build and deploy conversational agents that can interact with your customers using Large Language Models (LLM) and AWS Lambda functions.

## Getting started

!!! tip "All examples shared in this documentation are available within the [project repository](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python/tree/develop/examples)"

### Install

!!! info "This is unnecessary if you're installing Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python) via [Lambda Layer/SAR](../../index.md#lambda-layer){target="_blank"}."

You need to add `pydantic` as a dependency in your preferred tool _e.g., requirements.txt, pyproject.toml_. At this time, we only support Pydantic V1, due to an incompatibility with Pydantic V2 generated schemas and the Agents' API.

### Required resources

To build Agents for Amazon Bedrock, you will need:

=== "Using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)"
	Using [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/){target="_blank"} you can create your Lambda function and the necessary permissions. However, you still have to create your Agent for Amazon Bedrock [using the AWS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-create.html){target="_blank"}.

	```yaml hl_lines="18 26 34 61"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/sam/template.yaml"
	```

	1. Amazon Bedrock needs permissions to invoke this Lambda function
	2. Check the [supported foundational models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-supported.html){target="_blank"}
	3. You need the role ARN when creating the Agent for Amazon Bedrock

=== "Using AWS Cloud Developer Kit (CDK)"
	This example uses the [Generative AI CDK constructs](https://awslabs.github.io/generative-ai-cdk-constructs/src/cdk-lib/bedrock/#agents){target="_blank"} to create your Agent with [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/){target="_blank"}.
	These constructs abstract the underlying permission setup and code bundling of your Lambda function.

	```python
    --8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/cdk/bedrock_agent_stack.py"
	```

	1. The path to your Lambda function handler
	2. The path to the OpenAPI schema describing your API

### Your first Agent

To create an agent, use the `BedrockAgentResolver` to annotate your actions.
This is similar to the way [all the other Event Handler](api_gateway.md) resolvers work.

You are required to add a `description` parameter in each endpoint, doing so will improve Bedrock's understanding of your actions.

=== "Lambda handler"

	The resolvers used by Agents for Amazon Bedrock are compatible with all Powertools for AWS Lambda [features](../../index.md#features){target="blank"}.
	For reference, we use [Logger](../logger.md) and [Tracer](../tracer.md) in this example.

    ```python hl_lines="4 9 12 21"
    --8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/getting_started.py"
    ```

	1. `description` is a **required** field that should contain a human readable description of your action
	2. We take care of **parsing**, **validating**, **routing** and **responding** to the request.

=== "OpenAPI schema"

	Powertools for AWS Lambda [generates this automatically](#generating-openapi-schemas) from the Lambda handler.

	```json
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/getting_started_schema.json"
	```

=== "Input payload"

	```json hl_lines="4 6 13"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/getting_started.json"
	```

=== "Output payload"

	```json hl_lines="10"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/getting_started_output.json"
	```

??? note "What happens under the hood?"
	Powertools will handle the request from the Agent, parse, validate, and route it to the correct method in your code.
	The response is then validated and formatted back to the Agent.

	<center>
	```mermaid
	--8<-- "docs/core/event_handler/bedrock_agents_getting_started.mermaid"
	```
	</center>

### Validating input and output

You can define the expected format for incoming data and responses by using type annotations.
Define constraints using standard Python types, [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) or [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/).
Pydantic is a popular library for data validation using Python type annotations.

=== "Lambda handler"
	This example uses [Pydantic's EmailStr](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.0/usage/types/string_types/#emailstr){target="_blank"} to validate the email address passed to the `schedule_meeting` function.
    The function then returns a boolean indicating if the meeting was successfully scheduled.

	```python hl_lines="1 2 6 16-18"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/getting_started_with_validation.py"
	```

	1. No need to add the `enable_validation` parameter, as it's enabled by default.
	2. Describe each input using human-readable descriptions
	3. Add the typing annotations to your parameters and return types, and let the event handler take care of the rest

=== "OpenAPI schema"

	```json
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/getting_started_with_validation_schema.json"
	```

=== "Input payload"

	```json hl_lines="6-13 20"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/getting_started_with_validation.json"
	```

=== "Output payload"

	```json hl_lines="10"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/getting_started_with_validation_output.json"
	```

#### When validation fails

If the request validation fails, your event handler will not be called, and an error message is returned to Bedrock.
Similarly, if the response fails validation, your handler will abort the response.

???+ info "What does this mean for my Agent?"
	The event handler will always return a response according to the OpenAPI schema.
	A validation failure always results in a [422 response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422).
	However, how Amazon Bedrock interprets that failure is non-deterministic, since it depends on the characteristics of the LLM being used.

=== "Input payload"

	```json hl_lines="11"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/validation_failure_input.json"
	```

=== "Output payload"

	```json hl_lines="10"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/validation_failure_output.json"
	```

```mermaid
--8<-- "docs/core/event_handler/bedrock_agents_validation_sequence_diagram.mermaid"
```
</center>

### Generating OpenAPI schemas

Use the `get_openapi_json_schema` function provided by the resolver to produce a JSON-serialized string that represents your OpenAPI schema.
You can print this string or save it to a file. You'll use the file later when creating the Agent.

You'll need to regenerate the OpenAPI schema and update your Agent everytime your API changes.

=== "app.py"

    ```python hl_lines="24 25"
    --8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/generating_openapi_schema.py"
    ```

	1. This ensures that it's only executed when running the file directly, and not when running on the Lambda runtime.
    2. You can use [additional options](#customizing-openapi-metadata) to customize the OpenAPI schema.

=== "OpenAPI schema"

    ```json hl_lines="13 16 24"
    --8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/generating_openapi_schema.json"
    ```

To get the OpenAPI schema, run the Python script from your terminal.
The script will generate the schema directly to standard output, which you can redirect to a file.

```sh
python3 app.py > schema.json
```

### Crafting effective OpenAPI schemas

Working with Agents for Amazon Bedrock will introduce [non-deterministic behaviour to your system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-how.html#agents-rt){target="_blank"}.

???+ note "Why is that?"
	Amazon Bedrock uses LLMs to understand and respond to user input.
	These models are trained on vast amounts of data and are capable of extracting meanings from a sequence of text and understanding the relationship between words and phrases on it.
	However, this means that the same input can result in different outputs, depending on the characteristics of the LLM being used.

The OpenAPI schema provides context and semantics to the Agent that will support the decision process for invoking our Lambda function.
Sparse or ambiguous schemas can result in unexpected outcomes.

We recommend enriching your OpenAPI schema with as many details as possible to help the Agent understand your functions, and make correct invocations.
To achieve that, keep the following suggestions in mind:

* Always describe your function behaviour using the `description` field in your annotations
* When refactoring, update your description field to match the function outcomes
* Use distinct `description` for each function to have clear separation of semantics

### Video walkthrough

To create an Agent for Amazon Bedrock, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-create.html) provided by AWS.

The following video demonstrates the end-to-end process:

<center>
<iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NWoC5FTSt7s?si=AG2qpLJbxCkyiLma&amp;controls=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>

During the creation process, you should use the schema [previously generated](#generating-openapi-schemas) when prompted for an OpenAPI specification.

## Advanced

### Accessing custom request fields

The event sent by Agents for Amazon Bedrock into your Lambda function contains a [number of extra event fields](#request_fields_table), exposed in the `app.current_event` field.

???+ note "Why is this useful?"
	You can for instance identify new conversations (`session_id`) or store and analyze entire conversations (`input_text`).

=== "Accessing request fields"

	In this example, we [append correlation data](../logger.md#appending-additional-keys) to all generated logs.
 	This can be used to aggregate logs by `session_id` and observe the entire conversation between a user and the Agent.

	```python hl_lines="13-16"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/accessing_request_fields.py"
	```

<a id="request_fields_table"></a>
The input event fields are:

| Name                      | Type                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| input_text                | `str`                        | The user input for the conversation turn.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| session_id                | `str`                        | The unique identifier of the agent session.                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Additional metadata

To enrich the view that Agents for Amazon Bedrock has of your Lambda functions,
use a combination of [Pydantic Models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/){target="_blank"} and [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/){target="_blank"} type annotations to add constraints to your APIs parameters.

???+ info "When is this useful?"
	Adding constraints to your function parameters can help you to enforce data validation and improve the understanding of your APIs by Amazon Bedrock.

#### Customizing OpenAPI parameters

--8<-- "docs/core/event_handler/_openapi_customization_parameters.md"

To implement these customizations, include extra constraints when defining your parameters:

```python hl_lines="19" title="customizing_api_parameters.py" title="Customizing API parameters"
--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/customizing_bedrock_api_parameters.py"
```

1. Title should not be larger than 200 characters and [strict mode](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/strict_mode/){target="_blank"} is activated

#### Customizing API operations

--8<-- "docs/core/event_handler/_openapi_customization_operations.md"

To implement these customizations, include extra parameters when defining your routes:

```python hl_lines="13-22" title="customizing_api_operations.py" title="Customzing API operations"
--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/customizing_bedrock_api_operations.py"
```

## Testing your code

Test your routes by passing an [Agent for Amazon Bedrock proxy event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-lambda.html#agents-lambda-input) request:

=== "assert_bedrock_agent_response.py"

	```python hl_lines="21-23 27"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/assert_bedrock_agent_response.py"
	```

=== "assert_bedrock_agent_response_module.py"

	```python hl_lines="14-17"
	--8<-- "examples/event_handler_bedrock_agents/src/assert_bedrock_agent_response_module.py"
	```
